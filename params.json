{"body":"## textureSynth: a texture synthesis package for Matlab\r\n*This is a fork of the texture synthesis code by Javier Portilla and Eero Simoncelli:*\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis package contains MatLab code for analyzing and synthesizing\r\ndigital image of visual texture.  The algorithm is described in the\r\nreferences given at the bottom of this document.  Further information,\r\nas well the most recent versions of the code, are available at\r\n\r\n    http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/texture/\r\n\r\nIncremental changes to the code are documented in the ChangeLog file.\r\n\r\nWritten by Javier Portilla and Eero Simoncelli,  1999-2000.\r\n\r\nComments/Suggestions/Bugs to:\r\n    javier@decsai.ugr.es\r\n    eero.simoncelli@nyu.edu\r\n\r\n----\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n1) download and unpack the code.  You can put the code anywhere on\r\n   your system, but we'll assume it's in a directory named \"textureSynth\".\r\n\r\n2) download and unpack the matlabPyrTools package from\r\n          http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/software.html\r\n   This is a collection of tools for multi-scale decomposition of\r\n   images.  You can put the code anywhere on your system, but we'll\r\n   assume it's in a directory named \"matlabPyrTools\".\r\n\r\n3) Run matlab, and put the matlabPyrTools directory in your path:\r\n   > path('matlabPyrTools', path);\r\n\r\n4) Both the textureSynth and matlabPyrTools distributions include a MEX subdirectory\r\n   containing binary executables, precompiled for various platforms\r\n   (SunOS,Solaris,Linux,Windows).  You may need to recompile these on\r\n   your platform.  In addition, you should either move the relavent files from the\r\n   MEX subdirectory into the main directory, OR create a link/alias to them,\r\n   OR place the MEX subdirectory in your matlab path.\r\n\r\n----\r\nUSING THE SOFTWARE\r\n\r\n- To see a demonstration, start Matlab, change directories (using\r\n  \"cd\") into the textureSynth directory, and execute \"example1\"\r\n  (without the quotations).\r\n\r\n- If you want to learn how to use the texture analysis and synthesis\r\n  functions, take a look at example1.m and example2.m (these include\r\n  many explanatory comments).\r\n\r\n- For a listing of matlab function included in this package, execute\r\n     \"help textureSynth\"\r\n\r\n- For details on any of the functions, execute \"help <name_of_function>\"\r\n\r\n----\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nJ Portilla and E P Simoncelli.
